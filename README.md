# 🧠 Core Identity of WWWD

**"What Would Warren Do?"** is an AI/ML system that emulates Warren Buffett’s investment logic to:

- Give Buy / Sell / Hold decisions
- Provide explainable reasoning
- Leverage real-world market + macro data
- Act like a financial LLM agent + model pipeline

## 🧱 WWWD Architecture – Skill-Based Modules

| Module                      | Feature                                                                 | Skills Demonstrated                                      |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. ML Price Action Model    | Train regression/classification model on Buffett’s 13F data + macro indicators | ML expertise, data preprocessing, model development, evaluation |
| 2. LLM Decision Explainer   | Use LLM (GPT or open-source) to generate natural language explanations based on model outputs | LLM integration, prompt engineering, explainability      |
| 3. RAG System               | Retrieve Buffett quotes, letters, articles to ground LLM responses      | RAG, embedding models, retrieval pipelines               |
| 4. Workflow Agent           | Take in user input (e.g. "AAPL Q2 earnings just released") and update the decision | Prompt chaining, autonomous agents, context injection    |
| 5. Deployment & Serving     | Serve model and LLM via API (FastAPI)                                   | MLOps, containerization, deployment                      |
| 6. Monitoring & Observability | Log model outputs, errors, latency, and drift                         | ML observability, versioning, feedback loop              |
| 7. Internal Copilot UI      | Build a Streamlit or React dashboard to explore recommendations         | UX, human-AI interface, performance tuning               |
| 8. Prompt Benchmarking      | A/B test prompt formats and scoring (e.g. Langfuse, Trulens)            | Prompt engineering, testing pipelines                    |
| 9. Documentation + CI/CD    | Doc the pipeline, notebook setup, model versions                        | Reproducibility, team-readiness, DevOps                  |
| 10. Autonomy Tuning         | Add toggle for “safe Buffett” vs “bold AI-enhanced Buffett”             | Prompt variation, LLM control, experimentation vs stability |

## 🧩 Project Name: Still "WWWD"

Just make the README and website reflect that it's not a toy.

> “WWWD is an applied ML + LLM system that emulates Buffett’s decision logic using real-world financial data, explainable AI, and modern MLOps — built to demonstrate full-stack AI product development.”

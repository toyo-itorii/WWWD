## 📘 Chapter-Based Roadmap for WWWD

### Chapter 1: Data Foundation – Build Warren’s World
**Objective:** Set up clean, structured, ML-ready data sources that simulate Warren Buffett’s investment context.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] 🧾 Ingest Warren Buffett’s 13F filings (public holdings over time)
- [ ] 📉 Ingest historical stock price data (e.g. Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)
- [ ] 🌍 Ingest macroeconomic indicators (e.g. CPI, interest rates, GDP)
- [ ] 🧼 Clean, align, and join datasets by time/index
- [ ] 🧠 Feature engineering: momentum, volatility, sector tags, valuation ratios

**Outcome:**  
A reproducible, version-controlled dataset simulating “what Warren saw” before each investment decision.

---

### Chapter 2: Predictive Model – Learn Like Warren
**Objective:** Train an ML model that emulates Warren’s investment decisions using historical signals.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] 🤖 Define target variable (e.g. buy/sell/hold, or expected return)
- [ ] 🧪 Train baseline models (XGBoost, LightGBM, LogisticRegression)
- [ ] 📊 Evaluate performance with classification and ranking metrics (precision, top-k accuracy, etc.)
- [ ] 🧠 Log experiment runs with MLflow (or other tracking system)
- [ ] ✅ Save best-performing model and metadata

**Outcome:**  
A working ML model that predicts what Warren would have done on unseen data — with version control.

---

### Chapter 3: LLM Explainer – Speak Like Warren
**Objective:** Use an LLM to generate explainable, contextual reasoning behind the ML prediction.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] 🧠 Collect Berkshire letters, interviews, quotes, value investing books
- [ ] 🔍 Embed them using OpenAI or Hugging Face embeddings
- [ ] 🧵 Build a RAG pipeline (e.g. LangChain or custom) to feed context to the LLM
- [ ] ✍️ Craft prompt templates: “Why would Warren buy this?”, “Summarize the logic”
- [ ] 🧪 A/B test different prompt styles

**Outcome:**  
For each prediction, the system outputs a Buffett-style natural language explanation grounded in his philosophy.

---

### Chapter 4: Application API – Serve Warren
**Objective:** Build a backend system that exposes the ML and LLM functionality via a clean API.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] 🏗️ Build a FastAPI service with routes for:
  - [ ] `/predict` (returns buy/sell decision)
  - [ ] `/explain` (returns LLM reasoning)
- [ ] 🐳 Dockerize the API
- [ ] ☁️ Add local or cloud (AWS Lambda / ECS / SageMaker) deployment

**Outcome:**  
An end-to-end API that can be used in real products, internal tools, or other interfaces.

---

### Chapter 5: Dashboard – Visualize Warren
**Objective:** Build a dashboard for users to interact with predictions and see Buffett-style reasoning.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] 🖼️ Build a UI with Streamlit or React:
  - [ ] Upload a stock ticker and date
  - [ ] View prediction + natural language explanation
  - [ ] Historical Buffett logic timeline
- [ ] 🌈 Bonus: Add portfolio simulation — “What if Warren managed your ETF portfolio?”

**Outcome:**  
A usable front-end product that demonstrates real-world use and business value.

---

### Chapter 6: MLOps & Monitoring – Trust Warren
**Objective:** Make the system observable, reproducible, and ready for production environments.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] 🔄 Log all predictions + explanations for audit and analysis
- [ ] 🧪 Add evaluation + testing suite (unit tests, prompt evaluations)
- [ ] 📈 Add model drift monitoring
- [ ] 🧱 Implement MLflow for versioning, tracking, and artifact management
- [ ] 🤖 Set up a retraining pipeline (manual or scheduled)

**Outcome:**  
A production-grade system with MLOps hygiene, deployability, and trustability.

---

### Chapter 7: Show & Tell – Market Warren
**Objective:** Make your project portfolio-worthy and recruiter-ready.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] 📖 Write a README with project goals, architecture, and demo
- [ ] 📺 Record a short demo walkthrough (Loom or OBS)
- [ ] 🧠 Write 2–3 blog posts or LinkedIn articles on:
  - [ ] "How I Built WWWD"
  - [ ] "Using RAG + ML to Emulate Buffett"
  - [ ] "Full-Stack MLOps in Practice"
  
**Outcome:**  
A powerful showcase piece that demonstrates AI/ML, LLMs, RAG, and software engineering — all under a business lens.

## 🧩 Project Name: Still "WWWD"

Just make the README and website reflect that it's not a toy.

> “WWWD is an applied ML + LLM system that emulates Buffett’s decision logic using real-world financial data, explainable AI, and modern MLOps — built to demonstrate full-stack AI product development.”
